## Welcome to My About Page! ðŸŒŸ

Hello! I'm **Sarah**, and this website serves as a repository for my **Software Engineering Basics** course for the **Spring 2025** semester. On this site, you'll find my journey as I learn how to build and debug code, create websites, and explore how **large language models (LLMs)** can enhance development workflows.

### My Background
I have a background in aerospace engineering and I'm currently pursuing a master's degree at Beihang University. My research is centered around enhancing aviation safety and risk management, with a focus on applying text mining techniques to analyze aviation data and improve decision-making processes.

### What You'll Find Here
This site is dedicated to showcasing my assignments and projects from the Software Engineering course.
