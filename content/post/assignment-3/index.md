title: Assignment 3 - Deployment and Integration of LLM
description: This assignment focuses on deploying and using both online and local large language models (LLMs) to enhance development workflows. It involves configuring an API from an online LLM provider (like OpenAI), installing and running a local LLM using Ollama, and integrating both into an IDE such as VSCode or PyCharm. The goal is to demonstrate how these tools can assist in tasks like code generation and analysis.
